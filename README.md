# FileManagerProject
My own project to create a tool to easier navigate and find folders and documents


File manager that can find files and programs and discover whether they are available in your current repository. 

For example:
I want to code an app that uses the pycharm library and want to know if my current directory has access to that pycharm library, I then type in my directory and pycharm into the file manager and it finds both of them and tells me if there is access in my current directory or not.

Addition:
Show version of pycharm library
